# Basic Java Projects

Welcome to the **Basic Java Projects** repository!  

This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly Java projects designed to help learners understand core Java concepts and improve their programming skills.

## Projects Included

- **Geometric Shapes Calculator**: Demonstrates the use of abstract classes by calculating area and perimeter of various shapes.
- **Basic Math Library**: A basic math library packaged as a JAR that provides addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions. It can be easily added as a dependency in other Java projects.
- **Basic Mp3 Copier**: A simple program that reads an MP3 file byte by byte and creates an exact copy using Java's file I/O streams. It demonstrates basic usage of FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.
- **Student Grade Letter Calculator**: Reads student exam scores from a file, calculates weighted averages, converts them into letter grades based on university grading criteria, and writes the results to an output file. Demonstrates file I/O, string parsing, and conditional logic in Java.
- **Student Management System**: A console-based application that allows adding, deleting, listing, and identifying top-performing students. Demonstrates the use of data structures (linked lists), user input handling, conditional logic, and object-oriented design in Java.
- **Customer Management System**: A console-based Java application that allows adding, deleting, updating, searching, and displaying customer records. Demonstrates the use of data structures (doubly linked list), user input handling via Scanner, and object-oriented design principles. The program maintains customer information such as ID, name, contact details, address, and purchased product, enabling efficient management and retrieval of customer data.
- **Auto Gallery Management**: A console-based Java application that allows adding, deleting, listing, and searching vehicles in a gallery. Demonstrates the use of data structures by implementing a singly circular linked list to efficiently manage the vehicle records. The program maintains information such as license plate, brand, model, color, purchase price, sale price, and description, enabling easy insertion, deletion, and retrieval of vehicles in a circular linked list structure.
- **Course Enrollment Management System**: A console-based Java application that manages student enrollments using the stack data structure. It supports adding new students, removing the most recent one, displaying the top student, and listing all students. The system stores details such as ID, name, surname, and graduation department. By applying stack operations (push, pop, peek), it demonstrates the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle in a practical enrollment scenario.
